ðŸ‘‹ Hi there peeps! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page!  My name is Roukeyatou and hesitate to ask me how to pronounce it!

ðŸŒ± I've always had an affinity for things art related and fell in love with the design aspects of front end design.  I am currently learning various coding languages, but am learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, to name a few.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning creating a page using an API, that consists of HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery.  Also working to create a webpage using React as well as using an API to test out a live scenario.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m very much open to collaborations.  Anything to help expand the mind and coding palette if you will!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m primarily looking for help with JavaScript and API use.
 
- ðŸ’¬ I'm still fairly new to the game, but if you have a question regarding HTML and CSS, I won't lead you too far astray.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roukeyatou-takpara-a24935ba/">LinkedIn</a>

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her

- âš¡ Fun facts: I immigrated to the States when I was a baby.  A closet soccer nerd and love to bike on a nice warm day.
